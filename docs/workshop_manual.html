<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this workshop you will use the Raspberry Pi (RPi) which will scan for the presence of a type of Bluetooth
    beacon called a uriBeacon.
</P>
<p>
    This workshop will show you how to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Initiate a Bluetooth scan to find beacons</li>
    <li>Capture the information being broadcast</li>
    <li>Calculate an estimate of distance from the signal degradation between transmit and receive</li>
    <li>Display the distance using LED 'traffic lights'</li>
</ul>
<p>
    This workshop uses the JavaScript programming language to do the coding. Javascript is a popular
    language because of its wide use in web browsers.
</p>
<p>
    To run JavaScript on the command line you need
    a runtime environment and we will be using Node.js.
</p>
<p>
    There are lots of resources available online where you can find more information on what you have learnt today.
</p>

<h2>Audience Expectations:</h2>
<p>
    It is expected that you will have some experience of using a Raspberry Pi (or similar) and some experience
    of coding. <br>
    Not to worry if you don't fit that description as the steps are explained in the workshop and there are people
    on hand to help.
</p>

<h2>Goal:</h2>
<p>
    We will use some existing software modules along with a little of our own code to end up with a system that
    will allow us to track the proximity of uriBeacons.
</p>
<h2>Let's Get Started!</h2>

<p>
    In this workshop you will be working in a Linux Operating system environment. This is an alternative to
    Microsoft Windows popular with all types of Engineers. Linux commands are indicated by lines starting with; >
</p>
<pre>
    > The commands for you to type, or text you will see in
    the Linux Terminal, are in this text, and have a >
    at the beginning (don't type this)
</pre>
<p class="emphesis">Logging into the Raspberry Pi:</p>
<p>When the Raspberry Pi starts up you will be prompted to log in. The details are:</p>
<pre>
    > User: pi
    > Password: raspberry
</pre>
<p class="emphesis">Getting a graphical desktop:</p>
<p>Once you have logged in you will need to start the graphical desktop. This can be done by typing;</p>
<pre>
    > startx
</pre>
<p class="emphesis">Getting a Linux command prompt:</p>
<p>
    Once the desktop has started click on the icon at the top of the screen to open an "LXTerminal"
    which is a Linux command prompt window.
</p>
<p align=center>
    <img src="assets/LXterminal_pick.jpg" alt="LX Terminal on menu" width=50%>
</p>
 
<p class="emphesis">Some basic Linux commands:</p>
<p>Change to the directory where we save our work today;</p>
<pre>
    > cd node/beaconWorkshop
</pre>
<p>
    This is where we will run our JavaScript program from; more on this in a minute.<br>
    To list the contents of the is directory type; </p>
<pre>
    > ls
</pre>
<p>
    To be able to see the hidden files and sizes of the files in human readable format, type;
</p>
<pre>
    > ls -lah
</pre>
<p align=center>
    <img src="assets/ls_in_term.jpg" alt="Long listing of directory" width=70%>
</p>

<p class="emphesis">Starting an editor to enter your program:</p>
<p>On the command line type; </p>
<pre>
    > leafpad tracker.js
</pre>

<h2>Code:</h2>
<p>
    Type in the following code into the leafpad editor. When you've finished we will test and debug the code.
</p>
<pre>
    <div>
    <object data="../tracker.js" type="text/plain"
            width="100%" style="height:35em">
    </object>
    </div>

</pre>

<h2>Testing Your Code:</h2>
<p>
    When you are ready to run your code;
</p>
<pre>
    > sudo node tracker.js "1972" "1966"
</pre>
<p>
    Because we need interact with the GPIO pins to control the LED's we will run as <i>superuser</i> which is what
    the <i>sudo</i> command does.
</p>
<p>
    node is the runtime environment that will run our JavaScript program.
</p>
<p>
    The two numbers in quotes are identifiers of the two beacons we are going to track the proximity of.
</p>
<p align=center>
    <img src="assets/run_tracker.jpg" alt="Run code on command line" width=70%>
</p>

<p>
    When you run this code you will see output on your monitor (from the "console.log" statements in the code).
</p>

<p>
    Debugging your code means to test it and find any errors that prevent it running as you would like it to,
    or in fact not running at all!
</p>

<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>
    To give the Raspberry Pi the capability to sense Bluetooth beacons we need to add a dongle into the usb port.
    We also add some LED's as a simple way to show how close the beacons are.
